<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Andrew Wiles is a mathematician best known for proving Fermat’s Last Theorem. This celebrated achievement arose out of his earlier work on the study of elliptic curves and has led to significant advances in the field of number theory.</p>

<p>Among Andrew’s numerous contributions to mathematics has been the proof of the Iwasawa conjecture, which posited a relationship between two distinct sets of mathematical objects associated with algebraic number fields. This work allowed him to carry out further important work  on the Birch and Swinneton-Dyer conjecture, one of the Clay Institute's unsolved Millenium Prize Problems.</p>

<p>For his exceptional services to mathematics, Andrew was made Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000. Amongst his numerous other awards, he was also recieved the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society.</p>
